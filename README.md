  ## Installation
  From the appropriate directory, enter the command, "node app.js" in your terminal and answer the questions. When complete, an HTML file will have been generated in the folder named 'output' and is ready to be opened in the browser.
  ## Usage
  The first series of questions will take in information about your team's manager. After the user has answered these, the user is presented with the choice to add an engineer, an intern, or complete the questionaire. If engineer or intern is selected, those three choices will be given again after answering the relevant questions.
